# Pie à let mode

This is a fork of [Pie](https://github.com/the-little-typer/pie), the companion language for _The Little Typer_ by Daniel P. Friedman and David Thrane Christiansen.

This language is identical to `Pie` except that `let` (i.e. local bindings) and `equal` (i.e. equational rewriting à la Agda) have been added so slightly larger proofs/programs can more easily be written incrementally by a user while still getting useful feedback from the type checker.
